# SBA307 Restaurant Page

This is a simple restaurant landing page for a fictitious galactic spanning chain restaurant.

## Description

This website uses basic html, css, and bootstrap v5.3.3. Although I've known about bootstrap for a while, this is my first use of bootstrap. Forms should work but data is sent to https://httpbin.org/post for now.

This project was assigned by Per Scholas as part of technical training in software engineering.
